Champion Silencer
==================
This program makes it easy to silence certain characters in-game. Most notably Rhonin, Akazamzarak, the vendors on the mammoth mounts, and the latest champions introduced in Patch 7.2.

I've included the files you need to either build an executable using pyinstaller and Python 3.5.3, or you may simply run the script directly if you have Python installed.

How to
------------------
Start the program. If it says that it couldn't find the game installation, you may also place the program inside the game folder, the same place Wow.exe is located, then run the tool again. Select the NPC in the menu, check the boxes of what sounds you wish to mute and hit Apply.

There are several types of sound categories. `Talk` is related to the Patch 7.2 champions when they act as your bodyguard. `Combat` and `Combat (Battlecry)` are combat related sounds, some NPCs use their own combat related sounds that you can mute without affecting other NPCs that share combat sounds. `Gossip` is more general purpose sounds, often used in campaign related settings, the magician in Dalaran, Rhonin in Northrend Dalaran, the mammoth vendors, and so on.

Disclaimer
------------------
I have not seen or experienced anyone getting in trouble for creating blank textures or sounds then placing these in the correct paths for the game to load instead of the built-in files. These game file replacements do not provide any advantage to the player. Even so I feel obligated to mention that you are using this tool at your own risk. Anything that happens to your computer or Blizzard account is your responsibility.
