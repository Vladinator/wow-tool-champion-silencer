Champion Silencer
==================
This program makes it easy to silence certain characters in-game. Most notably Rhonin, Akazamzarak, the vendors on the mammoth mounts, and the latest champions introduced in Patch 7.2.

I've included the files you need to either build an executable using pyinstaller and Python 3.5.3, or you may simply run the script directly if you have Python installed.
